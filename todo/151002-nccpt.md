here is the run down on the October newsletter.

John,
i'll get you a preview soon as the articles are in there.

i had the idea of putting up a "sponsored post" and linking to it instead of putting it in the newsletter to reduce the chance of it getting marked as spam. i did some research and the more "buy now" type ads increases the spam score, but since the newsletter is effective to drive traffic to the blog, its a better space to display ads. there is already a space for it in the sidebar.


nccpt newsletter oct

- ceu articles.

need 4 or 5, can pull from old articles to post to the blog.

i can queue up CEU articles that have low purchase numbers that aren’t already on the blog.

Currently i have “coaching the postpartum athlete” (0.1 ceu) saved as a test draft. i can publish that and use it if needed.

Going to use http://blog.nccpt.com/2015/plyometric-training-for-seniors-yes-and-heres-why/ since the Senior Fitness manual will be ready soon, so this would be good to get people thinking about senior fitness, instead of springing it on them all at once. and we should probably post or promote more articles relating to senior fitness as well.
