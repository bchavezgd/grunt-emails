  excerpt:
    markdown: |
      a double blessing is a double grace,
      occasion smiles upon a second leave.
      yet here, laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
      the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
      and you are stay&apos;d for. there; my blessing with thee!
      and these few precepts in thy memory
      see thou character. give thy thoughts no tongue,
      nor any unproportioned thought his act.
      be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
      those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
      grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
      but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
      of each new-hatch&apos;d, unfledged comrade. beware
      of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
      bear&apos;t that the opposed may beware of thee.
      give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
      take each man&apos;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
      costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
      but not express&apos;d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
