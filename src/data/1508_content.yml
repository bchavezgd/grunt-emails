  title: President&rsquo;s Message
  copy: <p>I heard a podcast the other day in regards to licensure for personal trainers in Washington DC. On the call was Jeff Glassman the creator of Cross Fit. I have to give credit when credit is due. When one guy creates a format that encourages and motivates thousands of people to get active, you have to give him kudos. With over 10,000 locations and growing, this one man is responsible for making this happen. Are people getting injured? According to one study, <a href="http://ojs.sagepub.com/content/2/4/2325967114531177.full">20% of the people that participate in Cross Fit get injured</a>. Any time the intensity increases when exercising, the chance of injury also increases. Look at any intense sport&mdash;injuries may occur. That&rsquo;s a choice one makes.</p><p><strong>Back to the podcast.</strong></p><p>Jeff made a comment that Cross Fit was the only organization that offered live, hands-on training. This of course is incorrect. Every major certification, including the NCCPT offers live, hands-on training. It kind of bugged me when he said that. What I really liked was what he said about licensure. He focused on the sugar industry. Now you&rsquo;re talking! That&rsquo;s who really needs to be regulated --not personal trainers. Personal trainers and Cross Fitters are doing their part to improve the health of our nation. We often work long hours, don&rsquo;t have a steady income and rarely get benefits. We don&rsquo;t need more regulation to increase the costs of becoming and remaining a fitness professional. What we need is for the public to value and prioritize their health. In doing so, personal trainers will become more respected. There are good doctors and bad doctors. All of them have 8-11 years of education. In the end, it&rsquo;s up to each and every one of us to do our due-diligence to hire the right person whether it be a baby sitter, a roofer, a dentist or a personal trainer. I see a lot of people disparaging Cross Fit, however, I have to agree with Jeff Glassman. Regulate the sugar and food industry first. There&rsquo;s big money behind those lobbies. Leave the personal trainers alone. We&rsquo;re doing a great job!</p> <p>Anyway, time to get off my box and go for a swim! Keep up the good work and enjoy your summer.</p><p>Stay Fit,</p><p>John Platero<br>CEO</p>
