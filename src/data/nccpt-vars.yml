    excerpt: "When people think of endurance events, they normally think of marathons, triathlons, cross-country races or events that last longer than three hours. The longer competition times would lend a coach, trainer or nutritionist to focus on the aerobic system. But in order to win an endurance event, one must be able to fuel the anaerobic system because that is really where the competition is won or lost."

  excerpt: "Born and raised in Canton, Ohio by a single mom, Anton Kidd grew up passionate about baseball, basketball and football. Later on, he became obsessed with professional wrestling mainly because of the immaculate physique the athletes were in. He says, &ldquo;I saw them as what a man is supposed to look like.&rdquo; A role model of his at the time was Bo Jackson, because to him, he was the greatest and most diverse athlete there ever was.
