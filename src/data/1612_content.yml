      ## Certified Strength Training Specialist (1.9 CEU&rsquo;s)

      ![CSTS Banner](http://static.nccpt.com/images/161216-csts.jpg)

      Strength is the major component of all movements and the foundation of all fitness. Without strength we wither and die.

      All fitness goals, specifically sports or performance start with the person&rsquo;s strength and their ability to apply it.

      This course contains a very extensive manual along with video and one final exam attempt.*

      In this course you will learn:

      * What is Strength?
      * The Different Types of Strength
      * The Role of Biomechanics
      * What is Mechanical Efficiency?
      * Deeper Understanding of Flexibility and Stretching
      * Assessment Basics
      * The Sport or Weightlifting (as it applies to personal training)
      * How to Create a Strength Program

      ---

      ## Strength Agility and Speed Specialist

      ![SAST Banner](http://static.nccpt.com/images/161216-sast.jpg)

      Athletes will encounter many unexpected obstacles during a performance, and in their preparation they can create movement patterns or strength which can be the difference between a win or loss. While not incorporated in the title of the course, quickness is a component of many sports. This course does not discount the importance of quickness and does incorporate components, but rather places a larger focus on strength training which science is showing helps athletes just as much.

      Get your athlete to perform more efficiently and effectively. In this course you will learn different theories on speed, agility, and strength training that help improve performance and decrease the chance of injury. You will learn the fundamental drills to improve running technique, different theories on acceleration, how reaction time can improve agility, different way to alter you current drills, and different modalities to strength train your athlete with.

      ### Topics Covered in The Course:
      * The Specificity of Training
      * VRT Training
      * Stride Length & Stride Frequency Drills
      * Single Limb Training
      * Acceleration vs Maximum Velocity
      * Olympic Lifting Exercises
      * The Biomechanics of Running
      * and so much more!

        With the beginning of the New Year comes new year resolutions. This means that clients will start to pour in, expecting you to work your trainer magic and transform them from their holiday shell into Michael Phelps or Ronda Rousey within a matter of weeks. While this may be possible if they are already well on their way, it’s likely that their new year’s weight loss goals will not be made in the amount of time expected.

        Trends don&rsquo;t always stick around which makes it difficult to know what to pick up on and what to let lie. Shoulder pads? No, thank you! Skinny jeans? Yes, please! Like in the hair and fashion industries, fad diets and health trends flood the fitness market and then leave a few poor souls crushed in their receding wake.

        Every year the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) publishes a forecast of rising fitness trends. In 2015 one of the biggest indicators of significant movement in the fitness industry was the sharp increase in older client participation in fitness programs as an essential component of physician-recommended longevity health regimens. In other words, professional medical advice for seniors is starting to concentrate heavily on exercise.
