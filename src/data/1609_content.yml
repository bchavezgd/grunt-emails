  excerpt:

      Diet fads have stamped their place in history for the past several decades. From low fat, to low sugar to Atkins to Paleo – all of these “diets” have risen to mainstream media and caught the eye of weight watchers everywhere hoping the next diet will deliver the golden egg of getting (or staying) thin. Magic pills, magic doses, magic eating hours all have been discussed and discarded because the truth of it all is that calories matter. Even the guy who decided to eat Twinkies and Doritos for a few weeks but stay within a calorie deficit lost weight (albeit he probably felt like marshmallow crud). No matter how many diet books or celebrity weight loss articles hit our Facebook newsfeeds or Pinterest boards declaring the next new “miracle” promising to rip up your abs and shred your arms, we know the truth – calorie restriction is the key to weight loss. Eat less, move more and you’ll lose weight. Well, lately something “new” has entered our realm – fasting – and while in years past we’ve been taught fasting is the enemy and will force us into starvation mode – the new question arising from all the hubbub is this, is starvation really that bad for us?

        If you completed your yoga instructor or certified personal trainer certification program quite some time ago, it may be time for a refresh of your skills! This can serve a few purposes, including keeping your fitness instructor certification valid. Importantly, it can also increase your skills and help provide you with fresh new ideas to incorporate into your work with clients. Taking time to shift focus to your own training and practice can also be rejuvenating. Self-care is an important aspect of any fitness trainer job, after giving plenty of energy into our daily work. Let learning bring you back to the basics and inspire you all over again!

        We all go through those moments&hellip; we love working out while we are doing it and feel great after, but getting motivated to start our regular fitness routines has been challenging lately. People are habitual creatures and we like routine, but that routine can also get boring over time and make fitness feel like a chore. It doesn’t even matter if you are someone who goes to the gym once a week or twice a day, every day; this mental blockage affects everyone at some point in time.

        One of the more interesting things about market research is the little pebbles of information that stimulate thought. Sometimes they’re not all that earth shattering, but often they’re worth contemplating for greater meaning. And the nuggets of good stuff can come from any report in almost any year.
