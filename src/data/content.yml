      **Jeep wrangler or sleek sedan? Filet mignon or turkey burger?**

      Enough metaphors already&hellip; Trail running vs. Road running. That’s the real question. Which are you? Trail runner or road runner?

      The difference between trail runners and road runners isn’t what they wear on their feet or the car they drive or the even the meat they eat. *The difference lies between their ears.*

        Despite what many people would have you believe, personal training is something more than putting people through rigorous sweat breaking sessions; it’s also learning how to become a friend, a motivator, a mentor, and somebody who changes lives. It’s discovering what limits the capabilities of people, what drives them to success, and most importantly, what makes them tick. However, acquiring all these skills still amount to nothing if you haven’t garnered a solid, loyal clientele yet.

        We must first ask ourselves what the goal of the movement is?  This question will dictate whether we have a “fitness” set up or “competition” set up for the bench press.  Your goal or movement dictates the movement as references by the specificity of training.  For either fitness, bodybuilding, or performance, each person will have 7-points of contact: two feet, head, two scapula and two glutes.  These contact points will ensure that you are creating a stable environment, which will help prevent injury and increase the chances of a successful lift.

        We all go through those moments... we love working out while we are doing it and feel great after, but getting motivated to start our regular fitness routines has been challenging lately. People are habitual creatures and we like routine, but that routine can also get boring over time and make fitness feel like a chore. It doesn’t even matter if you are someone who goes to the gym once a week or twice a day, every day; this mental blockage affects everyone at some point in time.

        What might be the problem? First it is a good idea to do a quick self-evaluation on your lifestyle as a whole.
