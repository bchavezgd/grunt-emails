    excerpt:
      markdown: |
        In most sports, single-leg movements are an integral part of an athlete’s success.  With respect to the specificity of training, it wouldn’t make sense for an athlete making cuts or jumping off one leg to solely strength train their lower extremities with two feet on the ground.  If the majority of their sport is performed on one leg, movements in strength programs should provide stimulus to increase strength, decrease the chance of injury and improve performance.  Santana (2001) stated “because of the lighter loads and the more functional positions used in this unilateral training approach, single-leg training could be instrumental in prolonging athletic careers while enhancing performance”.  With single-leg training, an athlete can increase the cross-over of their training which is ultimately is the purpose of incorporating a strength training program.
