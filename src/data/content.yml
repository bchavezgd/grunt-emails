        Of all the body segments, the core is ultimately the most important when it comes to achieving and maintaining a certain level of strength. It doesn’t matter if your client is concerned with sports performance or merely getting through the day pain free, conditioned core musculature is the place to start.

        Tom DeLong, Director of Education, will post a new Dartfish video on the basics of the bench press movement.

        These videos address the mechanics of the powerlifting bench press as compared to the fitness/bodybuilding industry. Most in the training industry are very unfamiliar with applying biomechanical principles to this movement. Please note that the technique used for powerlifting is for performance enhancement in competition; however,  the basic movement patterns are very similar and can be used for the fitness public, if applied correctly.
