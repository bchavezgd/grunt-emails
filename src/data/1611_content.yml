    #   Let’s start with getting the basics out of the way. First, the majority of sport are performed on one leg. Running, stopping, cutting and jumping primarily occur with one legs&apos; force production. Second, single leg training is an accessory exercise to program design, and therefore not the end all, be all of exercise modalities. Lastly, it is important to incorporate a well-balanced program before introducing single leg training and to progress your client safely and slowly.

        When you lift your purse or briefcase, do you have the exact same weight stabilizing you on the opposite side? When you open or close a door, pick up a book, a frying pan, a glass of water, a can of paint or for that matter, perform anything with one arm, you’ll always be “loaded” on one side and stabilizing on the other.

      markdown: |
        At this day and age there are many uncertainties in business and the fitness industry especially.

        As a personal trainer, you got into this profession because you enjoy being healthy and fit but you also have this unique passion for helping other people achieve things that they didn’t think they were capable of.

        This is what I love most about the industry we have chosen. No other profession genuinely cares so much about helping other people. Talk about creating IMPACT.

    excerpt:
      markdown: |
        Small doses of essential amino acids are most effective in maximizing muscle protein synthesis after exercise. There is no evidence to suggest that consuming large amounts of amino acids(e.g. greater than 40 grams of protein) will provide a muscle &ndash;building boost. For example, 6 to 10 grams of essential amino acids (attainable by consuming 15 to 20 grams of high-quality protein) with some carbohydrate has been shown to optimize muscle protein synthesis.

        You’ve just gotten certified and you need clients, or you’ve been working for someone and want to branch out on your own. Or, maybe you’ve lost some clientele and need to replace them. Maybe you’ve just been hired as a personal trainer and whether you like it or not, if you’re not training clients, eventually you’re going to be let go.
