        It’s trendy so you know you want it! A strong core – this is a catchy phrase that may bring images of the perfect bikini body, a flat tummy or a six-pack to mind. Just like anything trendy is usually kind of shallow, there’s much more important considerations to core strength than what we can see on the surface.

        When people think of endurance events, they normally think of marathons, triathlons, cross-country races or events that last longer than three hours. The longer competition times would lend a coach, trainer or nutritionist to focus on the aerobic system. But in order to win an endurance event, one must be able to fuel the anaerobic system because that is really where the competition is won or lost.

        Chances are that if you’re starting a workout program, ‘toning up’ is probably one of the most important outcomes that you want to achieve from your time spent sweating. Did you know that the term tone comes from ‘tonus’, which is the technical term for a state of contraction of a muscle fiber? If all of the fibers within a muscle stay in a state of semi-contraction it results in the shape we commonly associate with a well-defined muscle.

        In a recent article in CNN Money titled “Best Jobs in America,” Certified Personal Trainer was listed as 18 out of 100 jobs in its category, with median pay being $56,000 and top pay averaging $128,000. (This is out of 251,400 total personal trainer jobs.) The personal training industry has grown 24% in the last ten years and is a potential financial windfall for those certified personal trainers who know how to build their client portfolio. The issue is, some personal trainers simply do not.
