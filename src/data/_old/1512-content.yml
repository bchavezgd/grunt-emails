      The holidays. That wonderful time of year filled with family, fun, happiness and cheer. It&apos;s a time to enjoy one another, relax, renew personal ties and reflect on the year as a whole. But with all the wonder of the season, there&apos;s a dirty downside clients face within the busiest six weeks of the year: stress, anxiety, depression, monetary pressure, time constraints, and an abundance of emotions (and not just for the clients).

        It's now confirmed what we already new.

        What no one really talks about is the ECONOMICS of eating meat and how costly it is, how ineffective it is to produce adequate amounts of food and worst of all, how devastating it is to the planet. Eating meat worked when there was less than a billion people, but with 7.125 billion people, the animals are basically drinking all of our water and eating all of our food. Every cow drinks about 20-25 gallons of water and 150 pounds of grain a day. Not to mention its affect on climate change. Yep! Climate change.

        Tom DeLong, Director of Education, will post a new Dartfish video on the basics of the bench press movement.  This video covers the basics of performing the bench from the fitness industry's point of  view for this exercise.  Included in this video will be: set up (7 points of contact), bar path (descent and ascent), primary plane of motion utilized, internal versus external lines of force as well as which section of the pectoralis major is primarily targeted depending of the position of the bar when it reaches the sternum.  This is part one of a series of bench press videos to compare and contrast fitness versus competition bench press movement patterns.

        My friend Gordon Gray has daughters that have been diagnosed with Batten CNL6, a rare neurodegenerative brain disease that is fatal. Children with this disease lose their ability to walk, talk, feed themselves, breathe on their own and eventually pass away. The disease progresses rapidly and children usually do not live past the age of 12. Their daughter Charlotte is already showing signs and in the last few months, walking and talking has become very difficult for her. If you have a moment, please view the short video about their story.

        Childhood obesity is a growing epidemic and is a national concern with lasting effects on health and wellbeing. Research shows childhood obesity has doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents over the past 30 years (1). Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate 17% (or 12.7 million) of today’s youth (between 2-19 yrs.) are now considered obese (2). Health related consequences of childhood obesity include increased incidents of high cholesterol, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, joint/bone problems and poor self-esteem (1). Consequently, children who are obese are more likely to remain obese as adults, perpetuating the obesity epidemic (3). As such, today’s fitness professional must understand the basics of childhood obesity and strategies for helping their young clients live active and healthy lifestyles.

      Qui-Gon Jinn was a revered, yet maverick and unconventional Human male Jedi Master. He was the Padawan to Count Dooku, and the mentor to Obi-Wan Kenobi and briefly Anakin Skywalker. Jinn often placed himself in conflict with the Jedi High Council. He was deeply attuned to the Living Force, which contributed to him frequently taking side trips to help seemingly weak and useless life-forms. Despite his opposition to the council, he was regarded by many Jedi as sharp-witted and possessing great wisdom.

      **President’s Message**

      Tis the season&hellip;

      We have much to be grateful for. Every day I’m thankful for where we live and what we have. I personally am thankful to just to be somewhat walking again.

      In this newsletter, we have two charities or benefits. One is for celebrity trainer Greg Joujon Rouche. Greg has trained Demi Moore, Leonardo DiCaprio, Toby Maguire, Pierce Brosnan, Brad Pitt and on and on. This wonderful man not only is a Father, friend and a great tribute to who a personal trainer should be—he has cancer. The other is Gordon Gray, a long-time friend of mine who has produced some of the best family entertainment there is: Million Dollar Arm, 42 and Secretariat are just three of the movies he has produced. Gordon is a kind man who always had a smile on his face and a positive word. Both of his young daughters that have been diagnosed with Batten CNL6, a rare neurodegenerative brain disease that is fatal. Children with this disease lose their ability to walk, talk, feed themselves, breathe on their own and eventually pass away. The disease progresses rapidly and children usually do not live past the age of 12\. There is no cure however Gordon and his wife Kristen have spent this past year tirelessly fundraising and have put together a medical research team that is working on a treatment which can potentially save their daughters. Please give whatever you can to these people

      Our new **Senior Fitness Certification was featured on ABC News**! You’ll be able to learn what issues to be concerned with and train this demographic safely and effectively. The baby boomers is such a huge demographic, this distinction will help you get more clientele and increase your business.

      Watch this movie **Cowspiracy.** It is shocking. I didn’t know about this subject matter and it’s frightening that no one speaks up about it. The producers have given us the rights to give you CEU’s for watching it and passing the quiz.

      Check out the **Dartfish** analysis on the bench press by our **Director of Education, Tom Delong.** Do you know you can download the app, take video and then send it to us for a biomechanical analysis? How cool is that?

      We have a few **CEU articles** to help you recertify and we’ve scheduled a few **live workshops** back East and of course here in California for those of you who like the live interaction. I personally like the live workshops.

      Remember how lucky we are to live where we live and be thankful for your health &mdash; there’s nothing better than being healthy.

      Happy Holidays!
