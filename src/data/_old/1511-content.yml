        Tom DeLong, Director of Education, will post a new Dartfish video on the basics of the bench press movement.  This video covers the basics of performing the bench from the fitness industry's point of  view for this exercise.  Included in this video will be: set up (7 points of contact), bar path (descent and ascent), primary plane of motion utilized, internal versus external lines of force as well as which section of the pectoralis major is primarily targeted depending of the position of the bar when it reaches the sternum.  This is part one of a series of bench press videos to compare and contrast fitness versus competition bench press movement patterns.

        In our modern day society, good posture is becoming more and more essential to the integrity or our health and well-being. Most of our jobs and transportation involve a seated position for hours at a time. Even the exercise equipment in the gym involves sitting! According to the research of Nachemson, this is the worst position for our spine.

      Born and raised in Canton, Ohio by a single mom, Anton Kidd grew up passionate about baseball, basketball and football. Later on, he became obsessed with professional wrestling mainly because of the immaculate physique the athletes were in. He says, &ldquo;I saw them as what a man is supposed to look like.&rdquo; A role model of his at the time was Bo Jackson, because to him, he was the greatest and most diverse athlete there ever was.

      Lately, since I’ve been injured I’ve been watching a lot more documentaries. This month we’re featured the documentary [&ldquo;**Forks over Knives**.&rdquo;](https://www.nccpt.com/store/products/forks-over-knives-3ceus-/1750) This is an extremely powerful film.
