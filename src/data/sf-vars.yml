  excerpt: Ever since he was a kid, Robert Spears was always mesmerized with superheroes and hoped that one day he could become one. Surrounded by nature and all that it has to offer, Robert made use of his upbringing in Anchorage, Alaska. He played football, rugby, soccer and considered himself a rebel, compared to other kids. Instead of candy, fun and games, Robert preferred the clean life&#58; healthy foods, physical activity and a vision to be big and strong. It got to the point where he says, &ldquo;As a child, I didn&rsquo;t even like the taste of most candy.&rdquo;
