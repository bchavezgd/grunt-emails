  excerpt: "Education is an ongoing process. The best companies ensure their staff are constantly up to date on their education and working towards expanding their knowledge - and that goes for every employee on every level. The back to school season is a great time to evaluate your staff&apos;s education and provide avenues for them to continue their education, learn new things or just brush up on topics they may have forgotten. Keeping a well trained, knowledgeable staff is a powerful tool in ensuring your club exceeds customer expectations.  CTA&#58; Explore Smart Fitness Education"
