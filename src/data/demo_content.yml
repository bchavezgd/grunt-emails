        The traditional Olympic sport of competitive weightlifting may not initially seem like a logical fit for a personal trainer. Weightlifting is a highly complex and technical sport in which to excel. Novices are challenged to learn proper technique and most newcomers expect to learn from an experienced coach.

        Even the most confident person can struggle to come up with a good response to “Tell me about yourself”. Having to write about yourself can cause the same reaction, leaving you blank. Even if you’re the most interesting and exciting person you know, all of your experiences, talents, and accomplishments can make it difficult to narrow yourself down to a few minutes or a few words. Making it even more difficult, most of us have been taught that bragging about ourselves is rude and conceited which makes jotting down our accomplishments in a humble way tricky.

        As an NCCPT trainer, winter can be a troublesome season. Most clients will want to work out indoors in the overcrowded, stuffy gyms, and some will lose all motivation to work out until it warms up again. Studies have shown that exercising outdoors can measurably improve mood and self-esteem along with other numerous benefits, but with the looming cold and threat of snow, how can you convince your clients that it’s actually better for them to leave their stash of cocoa and their cozy fireplace and get outside to exercise?

        Chances are that you spend a majority of your time sitting and stationary, unless your work is very active. Not only can sitting lead to weight gain, it can harm our posture and alignment, leading to bone, joint and muscles problems. The National Council for Certified Personal Trainers notes that a key potential stressors on the spine is sitting, with up to “30 – 40% more stress on the disc when in a seated position.” Reducing some of our time sitting can be helpful to our posture, but what else we can do to counteract our bad habits?
