      ## Certified Strength Training Specialist (1.9 CEU&rsquo;s)

      ![CSTS Banner](http://static.nccpt.com/images/161216-csts.jpg)

      Strength is the major component of all movements and the foundation of all fitness. Without strength we wither and die.

      All fitness goals, specifically sports or performance start with the person&rsquo;s strength and their ability to apply it.

      This course contains a very extensive manual along with video and one final exam attempt.*

      In this course you will learn:

      * What is Strength?
      * The Different Types of Strength
      * The Role of Biomechanics
      * What is Mechanical Efficiency?
      * Deeper Understanding of Flexibility and Stretching
      * Assessment Basics
      * The Sport or Weightlifting (as it applies to personal training)
      * How to Create a Strength Program
      * Overreaching, Overtraining, Detraining and Recovery Techniques

      ---

      ## Strength Agility and Speed Specialist

      ![SAST Banner](http://static.nccpt.com/images/161216-sast.jpg)

      Athletes will encounter many unexpected obstacles during a performance, and in their preparation they can create movement patterns or strength which can be the difference between a win or loss. While not incorporated in the title of the course, quickness is a component of many sports. This course does not discount the importance of quickness and does incorporate components, but rather places a larger focus on strength training which science is showing helps athletes just as much.

      Get your athlete to perform more efficiently and effectively. In this course you will learn different theories on speed, agility, and strength training that help improve performance and decrease the chance of injury. You will learn the fundamental drills to improve running technique, different theories on acceleration, how reaction time can improve agility, different way to alter you current drills, and different modalities to strength train your athlete with.

      ### Topics Covered in The Course:
      * The Specificity of Training
      * VRT Training
      * Stride Length & Stride Frequency Drills
      * Single Limb Training
      * Acceleration vs Maximum Velocity
      * Olympic Lifting Exercises
      * The Biomechanics of Running
      * and so much more!

        Excerpt from the **Certified Strength Training Specialist** manual, coming soon. part 1 of 3.

        ---

        The traditional Olympic sport of competitive weightlifting may not initially seem like a logical fit for a personal trainer. Weightlifting is a highly complex and technical sport in which to excel. Novices are challenged to learn proper technique and most newcomers expect to learn from an experienced coach.

        Even the most confident person can struggle to come up with a good response to “Tell me about yourself”. Having to write about yourself can cause the same reaction, leaving you blank. Even if you’re the most interesting and exciting person you know, all of your experiences, talents, and accomplishments can make it difficult to narrow yourself down to a few minutes or a few words. Making it even more difficult, most of us have been taught that bragging about ourselves is rude and conceited which makes jotting down our accomplishments in a humble way tricky.

        As an NCCPT trainer, winter can be a troublesome season. Most clients will want to work out indoors in the overcrowded, stuffy gyms, and some will lose all motivation to work out until it warms up again. Studies have shown that exercising outdoors can measurably improve mood and self-esteem along with other numerous benefits, but with the looming cold and threat of snow, how can you convince your clients that it’s actually better for them to leave their stash of cocoa and their cozy fireplace and get outside to exercise?
