<p>There is an entire arsenal of assistance exercises available for reinforcing technique and for developing further strength and power. Suffice it to say, a personal trainer&rsquo;s next step after teaching safe and effective technique is to master program planning and design. This is where a more comprehensive approach to successful weightlifting training occurs. </p>
<p>Finally, some personal trainers may find that they are working with a client who wishes to enter weightlifting competition. Competition preparation and execution is the third, and final, component of a good weightlifting coach. </p>
<p>While we have covered only the very basics of the lifts in this chapter, personal trainers are encouraged to seek further education and skills in order to more effectively apply weightlifting training to their client base. </p>
