We&rsquo;re going into Holiday Season! It will be difficult to keep people focused and on track, so it&rsquo;s up to you to help them!

You&rsquo;ll notice our crazy Black Friday Special and watch out for a Cyber Monday special as well. I just got off the phone with a GM in Florida who shared that they increase trainers&rsquo; pay based on the amount of certifications they have. The NCCPT now has nine different certifications with two more coming.

*   Personal Trainer
*   Group Exercise Instructor
*   Yoga Instructor
*   Power Lifting Instructor
*   Indoor Cycling Instructor
*   Kickboxing Instructor
*   Youth Fitness Specialist
*   Senior Fitness Specialist
*   Weight Management Specialist
*   Speed, Agility and Strength Training Specialist (coming soon)
*   Certified Strength Training Specialist (coming soon)

Take advantage of these specials because they won&rsquo;t happen again until next year!

I&rsquo;m sure all of you could use more clientele. Please check out the Off Day Trainer app because studies show that sales prospects who are sent text messages convert at a rate 40% higher than those who are not sent text messages. This app is super cool. It already provides you a variety of text messages to use with your clients plus you can customize your own! If you&rsquo;re in the Los Angeles/San Fernando area check out ProAthlos which is like &ldquo;Uber&rdquo; for trainers.

If you&rsquo;re close to Newbury Park, Ca, we&rsquo;re now allowing trainers to rent our gym space per-session or per-month. Photos are on our Facebook page.

We&rsquo;ll be introducing a referral program whereby with just your email address you&rsquo;ll be able to earn 10% commission on anyone you refer. I&rsquo;m going to begin teaching weekend workshops next year. The first one is January 21-22<sup>nd</sup>. If you need CEU&rsquo;s please come and if not, just refer someone and you&rsquo;ll get 10%!

Remember, what the holidays are about &mdash; sharing, giving and enjoying and appreciating each other and the gifts we&rsquo;ve received.

Stay Fit,

John Platero
