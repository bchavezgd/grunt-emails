2016! Wow&hellpis; Really? 

Is anyone interested in a mentorship at a gym? We’ve gotten requests from people recently certified to get experience in a structured environment. What if we could help place you in a mentorship program at a gym where you could learn the ropes and possibly get hired? If you’re interested stay tuned! This will be coming soon. We’ll post it on our new **NCCPT.com** website and Facebook.

Speaking of a new website. We’re happy to launch our new mobile friendly website! Hope you like it.

We have some new courses coming soon:

*   **Music Therapy for Personal Trainers**
*   **Video component for our Certified Powerlifting Instructor Course**
*   **Certified Youth Fitness Specialist**

We also have a very cool **Daily Training and Nutrition Journal** you can use with your clients.

The NCCPT has been developing a free app for trainers to use to attract new clientele and service their existing clientele. It’s called “**Trainer on the Go**” We need some of you to upload some photos and videos of exercises so we can further develop it. The app will be free so it will be a nice tool for you to use. Please fill out this form:

If you’d like to see the website for the app, go to:

The NCCPT Featured Trainer is **Kevin Starkey.** It was really cool how he turned a negative into a positive to become a NCCPT personal trainer. I admire a person who can reinvent himself.

As I write this, I can’t believe the month of January has already gone and the Super Bowl is right around the corner. Is it me?

Stay Fit,

P.S. Although, the Bronco’s defense played fantastic against New England, I don’t think anyone is going to stop Cam Newton and the Panthers. We shall see!
