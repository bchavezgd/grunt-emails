Spring is in the air! Remember, daylight savings time happens on March 13<sup>th</sup>. Don’t forget to move the clocks forward.

I was at a bagel shop the other day and witnessed two overweight people gorging on two huge barbecue pork sandwiches and French fries. It looked like they could have fasted for a month and still had enough calories on their bodies to not starve. I wanted to say something, but I couldn’t figure out how to say it nicely so I held my breath. Maybe we should just focus on people who actually want our help — the children. Read **“Strategies for Keeping Children Active”** for some ideas on creating healthy habits.

Some of you know I’m a drummer. Music is a magical thing that can help heal. It’s been shown that musical therapy can help with cognitive disorders. You don’t have to a virtuoso to integrate percussion into your practice. Check out **“Musical Therapy for Personal Trainers.”** You’ll find there are percussion instruments all around you just waiting to be played.

As Personal Trainers we apply force to our clients. Can you visualize where the force is greatest? If you can’t, then you need to learn what a **“moment arm”** is. Understanding the concept of “moment arm” and being able to visualize that moment arm will help you apply force to your clientele in a safe, specific manner. This new CEU course is a must for every one of you!

Lastly, almost all sports are performed leg-to-leg. Single leg exercises are an essential component of sports-specific training. Our new VP, Tyler Valencia shows you five cool exercises to integrate this concept!

Don’t forget, if you want to be extraordinary, you have to do extra ordinary effort! Make a difference!

Stay Fit,

John Platero
