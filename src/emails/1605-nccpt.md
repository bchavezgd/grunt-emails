Summer starts at the end of this month. People will have longer days and sunnier days to exercise. We hope that turns into some additional revenue.

April was our “Build Your Brand Month” and I filmed two short videos to give you some ideas on how to set yourself apart. One is called “Upper Body Blast” and the other is “Trainer’s Bag.” Take a look. I highly suggest you give document your clients’ workouts with our Daily Training and Nutrition Journal. I like using a tangible item they can carry around with them.

The NCCPT has been developing a free app for trainers to use to attract new clientele and service their existing clientele. It’s called “Trainer on the Go” We need some of you to upload some photos and videos of exercises so we can further develop it. The app will be free so it will be a nice tool for you to use. Please fill out this form:
