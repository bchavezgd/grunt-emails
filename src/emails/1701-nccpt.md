2017!

Since I was born on the 17th, I'm feeling really good about this year.

Please take note of all our new affiliates. These companies can help you make money and succeed as a fitness professional.

If you’re close to Newbury Park, Ca, we’re now allowing trainers to rent our gym space per-session or per-month. Photos are on our Facebook page.

We’re very proud of our featured trainer John Reiss. What he’s doing with kids with special needs is incredible. He’s an angel/trainer.

Are you doing small group training? What about Small Group Treadmill Classes? Check out our new course written by Scott McLain MA.

In most places the weather is not conducive to training outdoors. This is a perfect time to get more clientele. You can do it!

Stay Fit,

John Platero
