Happy Holidays!

We’re fairly close to launching our two new certifications:

Speed, Agility and Strength Training Specialist (coming soon)

Certified Strength Training Specialist (coming soon)

I’m going to resume teaching our 2-day live workshops in Newbury Park, Ca. The first one is January 21-22<sup>nd</sup>. If you need CEU’s or know someone wanting to get certified, send them our way. Remember, we now have the NCCPT Referral program. All you have to do is give someone your email address for them to enter when they purchase anything and you’ll receive 10%!

If you’re close to Newbury Park, Ca, we’re now allowing trainers to rent our gym space per-session or per-month. Photos are on our Facebook page.

Check out the Medical Fitness Network. They’re a great organization that can help you network with other health care professionals.

We’re very proud of our featured trainer Amber Stone. She has accomplished a lot in her time as a fitness professional.

Are you doing small group training? What about Small Group Treadmill Classes. Check out our new course written by Scot McLain MA.

Remember, what the holidays are about---sharing, giving and enjoying and appreciating each other and the gifts we’ve received.

Stay Fit,

John Platero
